# PatientSimulator
Development of a patient simulator robot

This project consists of the development of a robotic Mannequin that simulates patient reactions and symptoms of different disease. Its purpose is to be used to train nurse students in simulation where the clinical environment and the patient are represented as real physical objects. 

# The Patient Mannequin
The mannequin is based on a specifically designed medical training patient mannequin. This mannequin supports many clinical activities and functionalities developed under demand of the EERP- Escola de Enfermagem de Ribeirao Preto da Universidade de Sao Paulo.

# Electronic Monitors
The monitors display patient information received from the simulator main computer.

# Simulator Computer Interface
The interface consists of a control station that allows the Instructor to configure different functionalities for the mannequin. It is displayed on a notebook computer running Linux OS.
