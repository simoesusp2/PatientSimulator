# Hello :-)

My name is Maurício Richter. I am a student of Electrical Engineering – Emphasis on Energy and Automation Systems from University of Sao Paulo (USP) in Sao Carlos, Brazil.

I am working in this project of Patient Simulator, managemented by Eduardo do Valle Simões, which refers to a simulation including the most diverse clinical situations faced by health professionals in order to prepare medical students for all these adversities.

I am researching lung sounds and working on development of a software that will reproduce the sounds of respective disease through a loudspeaker.
